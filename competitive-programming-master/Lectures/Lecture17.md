## Greedy algorithms

### Coin problem 

A classic greedy problem is the coin problem.
We have a set of notes/coins { 1,2,5,10,20,50,100,200} and an amount x, find the minimum number of coins and notes used to have the amount x;

### Scheduling problem

Given n events with theirs starting and ending times, find a scedule that includes as many events as possible. It is not possible to sleect an event partially. 

|Event|Starting time|Ending time|
|-------|:------:|:------:|
|A |1 |3 |
|B |2 |5 |
|C |6 |8 |

Hint: start from the event start starts first and then select each event that events as early as possible. 


### Task and deadlines problem

Suppose to have a list with the id of the task, it's duration and deadline. For each task we earn d-x points where d is the task's deadline and x is the moment when we finish the task.

What is the largest possible score we can obtain?
In this case, we it does not matter the deadline but he duration of the task. For this reason, we have to orde the list of task in increasing order in according to the duration.
